Creating worksheets, Dashboards, and Stories with Tableau

## Overview of the Analysis
* Uncovering insights about Citi Bike's ride-sharing program (powered by Lyft!).

Learning objectives about Tableau's program design, such as importing various filetypes, using and changing column datatypes, measures, dimensions, continuous vs. discrete values, filters, pages, marks, dashboard, and stories were covered.
